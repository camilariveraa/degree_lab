Second step: Parse and structure each individual question from the extracted content, assigning question numbers, identifying subject, and estimating difficulty level\n4. Third step: For each question, provide a detailed step-by-step solution that includes: the reasoning for each step, all mathematical calculations shown, clear explanations in simple language, the final answer highlighted, additional concept explanation, and helpful tips to remember\n5. Fourth step: Compile everything into a final homework solutions document that includes: subject identification, total question count, all organized solutions, general study notes for the topic, and recommended learning resources like YouTube channels and websites\n6. Output: Complete homework solutions as a structured document"

Extract Content**: The `extract_homework_content` pipe uses vision AI to analyze the photo and produces `homework_analysis` (HomeworkAnalysis), which contains extracted text, subject identification, questions list, and visual element descriptions\n\n3. **Step 2 - Structure Questions**: The `structure_questions` pipe takes the `homework_analysis` and parses it into individual `structured_questions` (StructuredQuestion[]), assigning question numbers, subjects, and difficulty levels\n\n4. **Step 3 - Solve Questions**: The `solve_all_questions_batch` pipe processes each question in parallel using `solve_single_question` for each item, producing `question_solutions` (QuestionSolution[])\n\n5. **Step 4 - Compile Document**: The `compile_final_document` pipe takes all the analysis, structured questions, and solutions to create the final `homework_solutions_document` (HomeworkSolutionsDocument)\n\n6. **Output**: The complete homework solutions document\n\n## Consistency Check:\n\n\u2705 **Main pipe exists and is appropriate**: `homework_solver_sequence` orchestrates the entire workflow as required\n\n\u2705 **Main pipe inputs are consistent**: It only requires `homework_photo` as input, which matches the brief's input requirement\n\n\u2705 **No self-referential inputs**: The main pipe doesn't require any variables that it's supposed to generate\n\n\u2705 **Batching is correct**: The `solve_all_questions_batch` properly batches over `structured_questions` list\n\n\u2705 **Variable names and flow**: All variables are properly named and flow logically from one step to the next\n\n\u2705 **No PipeImgGen issues**: There are no image generation pipes in this flow\n\n\u2705 **All brief requirements covered**: Vision extraction, question structuring, detailed solutions, and final document compilation are all present\n\n**The flow has been checked and is consistent:**\n\n```\n# Homework Solver Pipeline Structure\n\n## Pipeline
